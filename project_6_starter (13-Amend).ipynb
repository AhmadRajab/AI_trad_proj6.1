    "When you implement the functions, you'll only need to you use the packages you've used in the classroom, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).

    "## Introduction\n",
    "When deciding the value of a company, it's important to follow the news. For example, a product recall or natural disaster in a company's product chain. You want to be able to turn this information into a signal. Currently, the best tool for the job is a Neural Network. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll use posts from the social media site [StockTwits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StockTwits). The community on StockTwits is full of investors, traders, and entrepreneurs. Each message posted is called a Twit. This is similar to Twitter's version of a post, called a Tweet. You'll build a model around these twits that generate a sentiment score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've collected a bunch of twits, then hand labeled the sentiment of each. To capture the degree of sentiment, we'll use a five-point scale: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive. Each twit is labeled -2 to 2 in steps of 1, from very negative to very positive respectively. You'll build a sentiment analysis model that will learn to assign sentiment to twits on its own, using this labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we should to do, is load the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Twits \n",
    "### Load Twits Data \n",
    "This JSON file contains a list of objects for each twit in the `'data'` field:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'data':\n",
    "  {'message_body': 'Neutral twit body text here',\n",
    "   'sentiment': 0},\n",
    "  {'message_body': 'Happy twit body text here',\n",
    "   'sentiment': 1},\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fields represent the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'message_body'`: The text of the twit.\n",
    "* `'sentiment'`: Sentiment score for the twit, ranges from -2 to 2 in steps of 1, with 0 being neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what the data look like by printing the first 10 twits from the list. "

Now we have a stream of twits. For each of those twits, pull out the stocks mentioned in them and keep track of the sentiments. Remember that in the twits, ticker symbols are encoded with a dollar sign as the first character, all caps, and 2-4 letters, like $AAPL.
